I recently stumbled upon a lovely detail on [Luma's website](https://www.luma.com/) when scrolling down a list of events. As you scroll past the date headings, they turn into floating badges.

There's no way to use CSS to style an element when it becomes sticky, so how the hell did they do it?

<Callout type="note" title="Good news everyone!">
  I'm almost wrong about this not being possible with CSS alone. We'll soon be
  able to [use container queries to detect when an element becomes
  sticky](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/css-scroll-state-queries#stuck). But
  as of this article's publishing, it's [only available in
  Chrome](https://caniuse.com/?search=scroll-state), so you're stuck with this
  for now.

## Making an element sticky is easy

Having elements become automatically sticky when scrolling is very simple. You just need to set [`position: sticky`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position#sticky) on the element and then set an inset property to control the offset relative to the nearest scrolling ancestor.

```css
.sticky {
  position: sticky;
  top: 0;
}
```

Now any element with this class will be `static` by default, but will become `sticky` when it hits the `top` of the nearest scrolling ancestor, which is usually the viewport. It will be offset by `0`.

<Callout type="tip" title="Using inset properties beyond top">
  While `top` is being used in this example, you can use any of the [inset
  properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/inset) to control
  where the element sticks to. At least one inset property **must** be set.
</Callout>

If we take our Luma example from earlier, we can use sticky positioning on the date headings like so:

<Example class="max-h-64">
  <JustSticky client:load />
</Example>

Now, our headings become sticky when they hit the top of the viewport, or in this case the top of the scrolling ancestor.

But the headings just float over the content, which doesn't look clean or as slick. Once you have images and text instead of the placeholders in my example, it will look even worse.

So, how can we style the headings to stand out when they become sticky?

## Detecting when an element becomes sticky is tricky

As of this writing, there is no way to detect when an element becomes sticky using CSS alone. We have to rely on JavaScript to detect when an element becomes sticky.

Thankfully, we have a Web API that can help us out: [`IntersectionObserver`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API). If you've not heard of this API before, you're about to discover one of modern web development's best tools.

### `IntersectionObserver` to the rescue

At its simplest, the `IntersectionObserver` API allows you to detect the relative visibility of two elements, giving us a way to asynchronously observe (i.e. performant and non-blocking) when one of those elements intersects with the other.

Typically you would use this API to detect when an element becomes visible within the viewport, or within a scrollable ancestor, but the API is very flexible, supporting many different use cases.

<Callout type="tip" title="Learning more about IntersectionObserver">
  This guide isn't going to cover the IntersectionObserver API in detail, just enough for sticky detection. If you'd like to learn more about the API, I'd recommend two great resources:

  <ul>
    <li>[MDN's IntersectionObserver documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API) the web developers bible entry</li>
    <li>[Dynamic Header

### Sticky detection with `rootMargin`

Sticky elements present us with a unique challenge when using `IntersectionObserver`: if the element is sticky, it unlikely intersects with the viewport until it hits the bounds of it's container element, at which point it becomes fixed in place and is no longer sticky ðŸ¤”.

That's where the [`rootMargin` option](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserver/rootMargin) comes in, which allows us to specify a margin around the root element (usually the viewport, but can be any element or scrollable ancestor).

<Figure
  src={SVGStickyHeaderRootMargin}
  alt="A diagram showing how rootMargin is used in IntersectionObserver, specifically that you can use negative insets to create an inner margin."
  caption="The rootMargin property allows us to specify a margin around the root element, which is usually the viewport, but can be any element or scrollable ancestor."
/>

`rootMargin` is given a string value of inset properties, and you can give it negative insets to create an inner margin.

By telling the observer to observe the element with a `rootMargin` of `-10px 0px 0px 0px`, for example, we're telling the observer to consider the target element as intersecting when it's `10px` from the top of the viewport.

**ðŸ§  Here's the big brain bit:** by setting the `rootMargin` with a negative inset that matches the offset of the sticky element, we can reasonably deduce that when the element is within the `rootMargin` it is **not** sticky. So we just need to check for the inverse, and style accordingly.

## The final solution

We'll use `IntersectionObserver` to observe when our target sticky element leaves our root element, but we'll add a negative `rootMargin` to account for the sticky element's offset.

<Example id="example-sticky-detect" class="max-h-64">
  <StickyDetect client:visible />
</Example>

As an added measure here, we're also checking if the element is intersecting where we expect it to be to avoid false positives (i.e. we think the element is sticking, but we just haven't scrolled past it yet).

Finally, we'll use the `dataset` property to store the state of the element, as that then allows us not only to style the element with simple CSS, but gives us the potential to run code when that state changes if desired.

Combining all of that above, we end up with some plain JavaScript like so:

```js showLineNumbers
const stickyElements = document.querySelectorAll(".detect-sticky")

if (!stickyElements) return

stickyElements.forEach((stickyElement) => {
  const observer = new IntersectionObserver(
    ([e]) => {
      let isSticky = false

      if (e.intersectionRect.top === e.rootBounds?.top) {
        isSticky = true
      }

      stickyElement.dataset.currentlySticky = String(isSticky)
    },
    {
      rootMargin: "-15px 0px 0px 0px",
      threshold: [1],
    },
  )

  observer.observe(stickyElement)
})
```

Let's step through the details inside the `IntersectionObserver` callback.

```js showLineNumbers startLineNumber=8
let isSticky = false

if (e.intersectionRect.top === e.rootBounds?.top) {
  isSticky = true
}
```

Here we're checking if the top edge of the intersection rectangle exactly matches the top edge of the root bounds. If it does, we know the element is sticking to the top of the root element, and we can set the `isSticky` variable to `true`.

You'll want to change the check here if you're using something other than the `top` inset property for the `rootMargin`.

```js showLineNumbers startLineNumber=14
stickyElement.dataset.currentlySticky = String(isSticky)
```

We set the `dataset.currentlySticky` property to the `isSticky` variable, which we can then use in our CSS to style the element accordingly. You'll want to change

In addition to the callback, we're also passing some options to the `IntersectionObserver`.

```js showLineNumbers startLineNumber=16
{
  rootMargin: "-15px 0px 0px 0px",
  threshold: [1],
}
```

Add a negative top margin to the observer's root, to account for the sticky element's offset (including margin and padding). It's a good idea to a couple of pixels on top of the sticky offset, as sticky elements don't become sticky until moving past the sticky offset, and there can be rounding errors. You should play around to get a feel for the right value.

The [`threshold` option](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserver/thresholds) isn't something we've covered in detail here, but it's an array of numbers between 0 and 1 that represent the percentage of the element that must be visible in order to be considered an intersection.

In this case, we're saying that the element must be 100% visible in order to be considered an intersection. This is important because we want to avoid false positives, where we think the element is sticking, but we just haven't scrolled past it yet.

And that's it! We've now got a way to detect when an element becomes sticky, and we can use that state to style the element accordingly.
