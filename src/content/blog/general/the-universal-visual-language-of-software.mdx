subtitle: A collection of visual language patterns for software
description: Collectively as a people, we seem to have agreed upon a visual language used in software to convey meaning without words. That's kinda cool.

One of the many things I love about software is the visual language we seem to have collectively developed. Generally this comes in the form of icons, using them as if digital hieroglyphs, though over time that seems to have also included other visual patterns too.

These digital hieroglyphs sometimes take the form of seemingly obscure shapes, but behind them contain a hidden yet accepted meaning. An understanding of what they signify when placed relative to other things, or an expectation of what will happen should you interact with it.
