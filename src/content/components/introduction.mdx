## Components

I like to build components that might have a bit of a niche use case, but are still often needed. The kind of components you might not typically find in a UI library.

Generally speaking my components are:

- Accessible, adhering to WAI-ARIA guidelines
- Styled via Tailwind CSS (and customisable via Tailwind CSS)
- Typesafe thanks to TypeScript
- [Installable](/playground/installing-components) via the shadcn CLI (or manually)
- Usable in any React-based framework or project

I hope you'll find them useful.

## Tools

Outside of building components, I'll sometimes build tools that are usually web-development related. These might be templates, packages, scripts, etc..
